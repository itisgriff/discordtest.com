description: The .cursor/rules/general.mdc file is my learning journal for each project. It captures important patterns, preferences, and project intelligence that help me work more effectively. As I work with you and the project, I'll discover and document key insights that aren't obvious from the code alone.

# Project Intelligence

## API Routing Configuration
- Port 8788 is used for both development and preview environments
- API routes must be explicitly configured in _routes.json with allowed methods
- API routes should not be in the exclude list of _routes.json
- Preview environment requires using wrangler pages dev with the dist directory

## Development Workflow
- Build and preview command: `pnpm run build && pnpm dlx wrangler pages dev dist --port 8788`
- API endpoints are handled by Cloudflare Functions
- Frontend routes are handled by the SPA configuration

## API Response Handling
- Use minimal type checking for essential fields only (id, username for users; id, name for guilds)
- Handle optional fields with nullish coalescing for safe defaults
- Type assertions used for flexible field access
- Discord API returns user data directly, not wrapped in a 'user' property
- This approach maintains stability when Discord API changes
- Rate limiting handled with Retry-After header parsing
- Consistent error handling across all API endpoints

## Frontend Patterns
- Immediate data fetching on user actions
- URL updates happen alongside API calls, not before
- useEffect handles external URL changes only (direct links, navigation)
- Maintain URL as source of truth while optimizing UX
- Consistent behavior between button clicks and Enter key
- Input handlers update local state immediately
- Form submissions trigger both URL update and API call
- Loading states prevent duplicate submissions
- Error boundaries protect against component failures
- Responsive UI updates provide immediate feedback
